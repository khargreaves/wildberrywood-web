I'm Katie and I'm a Level 3 Forest School Leader. I'm a
qualified teacher, and have worked with children of all age
groups. I've also volunteered extensively with Guiding and Scouting
groups, both in the UK and Sweden. I lived in Sweden for 5 years where
I was inspired by their approach to 'friluftsliv', or outdoor
living. I subscribe to the Swedish philosophy that there's 'no such
thing as bad weather, only bad clothing!'

I hold a Forest School First Aid certificate, am DBS cleared, and have
public liability insurance to carry out Forest School sessions. Copies
of these documents can be viewed on request.
