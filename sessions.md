## Little Explorers Spring 2021

Little Explorers is back! We are thrilled to be able to start offering our Forest School style preschool sessions at Poverest Park once more. However, due to the ongoing risks associated with Covid-19 we have made a few changes to our set up. 

Sessions will be **pre-booked only**. Please do not come unless you are booked in. This is to ensure that we adhere to current government guidelines. 

Upcoming dates for this half term are: 

* Monday 26th April
* Monday 3rd May (bank holiday)
* Monday 10th May
* Monday 17th May

Time: 10.15-11.45

The cost will be £7 per child per session - or book all four for the discounted price of £24 - payable in advance to secure your place. Only one accompanying adult is permitted per child. The recommended age range is from walking to school start. Pre-walking siblings are free of charge. 

## Please read the following booking conditions carefully:

* In line with government guidelines numbers will be strictly limited to a maximum of 15 adults. We therefore ask that only one adult accompany each child at this time. If you are bringing two children you may bring another adult. Please fill out a separate booking form for each child. 
* You MUST NOT attend if you or your child are experiencing [Covid-19 symptoms](https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/coronavirus-covid-19/symptoms/) or are awaiting test results. Refunds will be issued if you have to cancel due to Covid-19.
* 2m social distancing will be observed, but in case it is not possible at all times adults are encouraged to wear face coverings. 
* Sessions go ahead in all weathers (except high winds and thunderstorms) so please make sure you and your child dress appropriately. It is wise to layer up. Waterproof jackets and boots are essential, and waterproof trousers or puddle suits can be useful even if it is not wet, as children like to sit on the ground. We strongly recommend wearing long sleeves and trousers and closed-toed shoes in all weathers to avoid scratches and biting insects.
* Hot and cold drinks will be served, but please bring your own snacks. 
* Toilets and handwashing facilities are available in the football pavilion. We will also provide extra handwashing facilities and hand sanitiser in the woods.
