* Sessions go ahead in all weathers (except high winds and thunderstorms) so please make sure you and your child dress appropriately. It is wise to layer up. Waterproof jackets and boots are essential, and waterproof trousers or puddle suits can be useful even if it is not wet, as children like to sit on the ground. We strongly recommend wearing long sleeves and trousers and closed-toed shoes in all weathers to avoid scratches and biting insects.

## Activities

Our theme of this half term will be Let's Go Wild, inspired by the [Wildlife Trusts' 30 Days Wild challenge](https://www.wildlifetrusts.org/30-days-wild-2021-sign-your-pack), which aims to get everyone out and about committing 'random acts of wildness' during the month of June. 

We believe that enjoying nature has never been more important for all our well-being. Little Explorers is run along Forest School principles of free play and child-centred learning. Children are encouraged to assess risk, and to take part in more challenging activities, such as using tools and navigating obstacles, in a managed way. The result is an increased sense of confidence and self-esteem. Plus it's lots of fun!
