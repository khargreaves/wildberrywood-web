Little Explorers Autumn 2020

Little Explorers is back! We are thrilled to be able to start offering our preschool sessions at Poverest Park once more. However, due to the ongoing risks associated with Covid-19 we have had to make quite a few changes to our set up. The most significant of these is that SESSIONS ARE NO LONGER DROP IN. Please do not come unless you are booked in. This is to avoid over-crowding. 

This half term we are taking bookings for a block of 5 sessions at a time. We hope to be able to return to a more casual approach in the future, but these measures will enable us to get out and enjoy the fresh air as safely as possible.

Autumn dates:
* Monday 28th September
* Monday 5th October
* Monday 19th October
* Monday 26th October
* Monday 2nd November

(Please note there will be no session on Monday 12th October).

The cost will be Â£40 per child for all five sessions, payable in advance to secure your place. Only one accompanying adult is permitted per child. By prebooking the sessions we aim to ensure that:
* We keep the numbers of children and adults strictly limited to help social distancing
* We have your contact information in case we need to inform you of an infection report or have to cancel at short notice
* Activities and equipment can be prepared in advance

Refunds will be given if sessions have to be cancelled e.g. due to Covid-19, or extreme weather (high winds/thunderstorms). Please note sessions will go ahead if it's raining so please make sure you and your child dress appropriately!  

IMPORTANT:
Adults are required to wear face coverings (unless exempt).
You MUST NOT attend if you or your child are experiencing Covid-19 symptoms. As a precaution temperature checks will be carried out at the start of each session.
