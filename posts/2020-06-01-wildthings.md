# Where the Wild Things Are

1st June marks the start of [30 Days Wild](https://action.wildlifetrusts.org/page/57739/petition/1), an initiative by the Wildlife Trusts to get us all enjoying nature. If you register you'll be sent a free activity pack to download.

*[Where the Wild Things Are](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xex-63PNXrc),* by Maurice Sendak, tells the story of Max, who having made 'mischief of one kind and another', is sent to bed without any supper. That night a forest grows in his room, and he journeys by boat to Where the Wild Things Are. The Wild Things make him their King, and they celebrate with a 'wild rumpus'. Eventually, Max grows tired of being King of the Wild Things, and wants to be back 'where someone loved him best of all'. He sails home to find his supper waiting for him: 'and it was still hot'. I like this story because it reminds us that we're loved, even if we've been naughty. 

You and your child can have fun being Wild Things:
<br>*they roared their terrible roars and gnashed their terrible teeth and rolled their terrible eyes and showed their terrible claws*

Have a go at making a crown to be King of all the Wild Things. Take a piece of A4 card or paper and cut it in half lengthways with zig-zag cuts. Tape or staple the two halves together at the narrow ends. Let your little one decorate it with colours, scraps of paper, stickers or even leaves, flowers or feathers that you've found outside.

# Taming the Wild Things

Of course there comes a point where we'd like our Wild Things to calm down a bit. Simply being outside and noticing nature can help us feel calmer. Here are a few quick and easy ideas to try:
* spot shapes in the clouds
* have a meal outside
* go barefoot - connect to the earth
* go on a bug hunt
* listen to the birds
* follow a bee on its journey
* collect natural objects and arrange them to make a picture or pattern

If you're still feeling a bit wild, try doing some yoga. My daughter loves [Cosmic Kids](https://www.youtube.com/user/CosmicKidsYoga). Each episode tells a story which helps to keep her attention. 

If you sign up for [30 Days Wild](https://action.wildlifetrusts.org/page/57739/petition/1) you'll also find some ideas for nature-based yoga poses. Can you invent your own? Could you make up a story to join your favourite yoga poses together?

We'd love to hear about your 'random acts of wildness'. You can post comments and pictures on our [Facebook page](https://www.facebook.com/wildberrywood). Let's go wild this June!
