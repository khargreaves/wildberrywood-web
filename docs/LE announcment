Little Explorers is back! We are thrilled to be able to start offering our preschool sessions at Poverest Park once more. However, due to the ongoing risks associated with Covid-19 we have had to make quite a few changes to our set up. The most significant of these is that SESSIONS ARE NO LONGER DROP IN. Please do not come unless you are booked in. This is to avoid over-crowding. 

This half term we are taking bookings for a block of 5 sessions at a time. The cost will be 40 per child for 5 weeks. We hope to be able to return to a more casual approach in the future, but these measures will enable us to get out and enjoy the fresh air as safely as possible.
