    <h2>Dinosaurs</h2>
  </div>
  <h1>Everybody Walk the Dinosaur!</h1>
<p>Kids love dinosaurs. The roaring, the stomping, the big sharp teeth - what's not to like? And it's definitely not just a boy thing. One of history's greatest fossil hunters was <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/bitesize/topics/zd8fv9q/articles/zf6vb82">Mary Anning</a>, a poor woman from Dorset who discovered the ichthyosaurus and plesiosaurus. </p>
<p>Dinosaur toys lend themselves really well to imaginative games. They can hide in 'caves' around the house - under the furniture, in cardboard boxes or blanket dens. Outside they can stomp around in the mud or 'forests' of long grass. There's a lovely series of books about a boy called Harry who finds a <a href="https://www.booktrust.org.uk/book/h/harry-and-the-bucketful-of-dinosaurs/">Bucketful of Dinosaurs</a>. They go everywhere with him, and help him navigate tricky situations like going to the dentist, meeting new people, and starting school. One of my  favourite Harry stories is <em><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XCXHuSEGuhc">Romp in the Swamp</a></em> in which Harry makes a new friend, Charlie, who is great at inventing imaginative games using things she's found around the house and garden. </p>
<h1>Get Exploring</h1>
<p>If you drink filter coffee at home, check out this recipe for <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/cbeebies/makes/presenters-making-a-fossil">home made fossils</a>. You can make the imprint of toys, shells etc in the soft dough, and let it harden into a solid 'rock'.</p>
<p><img src="/images/bugfossil.jpg" alt="" /></p>
<p>If you've got some small plastic dinosaur toys, try putting them in a container full of water in the freezer. When they're frozen have fun melting the ice with your hands. It feels lovely on a hot day! </p>

<h1>Get Arty</h1>
<p>If you've got some spare cardboard boxes, have a go at turning them into caves for your dinos. You could do some cave art with pens, crayons, or chalk or charcoal if you have some. </p>
<p>A really simple way of drawing a dinosaur picture is to trace around your hand, in the position shown below. </p>
<p><img src="/images/hand.jpg" alt="" /></p>
<p>Then simply add eyes, spikes, sharp teeth, maybe even spots or stripes. Remember, no one knows for sure what colour dinosaurs were! </p>

<p>Thanks to Megan and family for this great artwork! </p>
<h1>Songs and Stories</h1>
<p>There are countless books about dinosaurs. Does your little one have a favourite?</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>We like <em><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E7gNfVcelPE">Ten Little Dinosaurs</a></em>, which is a fun way to practise counting.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zDrYcnh-cV4">Stomp, Chomp, Big Roars! Here Come the Dinosaurs!</a></em> always gets us stomping and roaring. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>One of my favourite songs to sing in the woods is 'Where's the Dinosaur?' (to the tune of 'Wind the Bobbin Up'):</p>
</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>Where's the dinosaur? Where's the dinosaur? <br>
Here, there, everywhere (x2)<br>
Are they in the sky?<br>
Are they on the ground?<br>
Are they in the bushes, hiding all around?<br>
Clap your hands together, 1,2,3<br>
Hey Mr Dinosaur, you can't catch me!<br></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Have a ROARSOME time playing with dinosaurs! </p>
