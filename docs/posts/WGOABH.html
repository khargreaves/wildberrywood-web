    <h2>We're Going on a Bear Hunt</h2>
  </div>
  <h1>We're Going on a Bear Hunt!</h1>
<p>We love this classic story, which introduces little ones to a host of obstacles they might encounter on an adventure. It's lots of fun to act out together. You can <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0gyI6ykDwds">watch it being performed by the author Michael Rosen</a>.</p>
<p>Bears represent both threat and comfort in our imaginations. Although the characters in the story are scared of the bear, at the end he looks lonely. I think he just wants to be friends! Most of us have a favourite soft toy that comforts us. Try drawing around the outline of your child's toy and letting them colour in and decorate it. Then they can give it to someone they love as a gift, a protective spirit to take care of that person if they are feeling down. Even grown ups get sad and worried sometimes! </p>

<p>The advantage of being a small child during the current crisis is their vivid imagination. You don't have to go on a real expedition to have an adventure. Try going on a bear hunt around your house or garden. What will you find? You could hide objects for your child to discover, or simply have a look at things afresh. There's so much to see when we look through their eyes. Have a go at building your own bear cave, either inside or outside, with cushions, blankets or boxes. How about having a picnic in your new den?</p>
<h1>Cheesy Teddy Bears</h1>
<p>Here's a recipe for cheese scones that I often make with my daughter. She can get involved at every stage apart from using the oven. They're quick to bake so great for a picnic lunch if you've run out of bread. We make teddy bears because that's the cutter we have, but you can use any shape, or the rim of a glass.</p>
<p><em>Ingredients:</em></p>
<ul>
<li>225g self-raising flour (if you only have plain, increase the baking powder by 1.5 tsp)</li>
<li>1 tsp baking powder</li>
<li>50g butter</li>
<li>50g grated cheese</li>
<li>150ml milk</li>
<li>(optional) a little extra milk and grated cheese</li>
</ul>
<p><em>Method:</em></p>
<ul>
<li>Preheat the oven to 220°C. Line a baking sheet with parchment.</li>
<li>Put the flour and baking powder into a large bowl. </li>
<li>Cut the butter into cubes and use your hands to rub it into the flour, until it resembles breadcrumbs. </li>
<li>Stir in the grated cheese and then the milk. </li>
<li>Turn out onto a floured surface and bring together into a ball. Roll out to 1cm thick, then use your chosen cutter to make shapes (we usually get six bears, plus a 'blob'). </li>
<li>Optional: brush the tops with a little extra milk, and sprinkle with some extra grated cheese. </li>
<li>Bake at 220°C for 12-15 minutes until well risen and golden. </li>
<li>Go on a teddy bear's picnic!</li>
</ul>

<h1>Make a Song and Dance</h1>
<p>I've adapted this action rhyme to get you in the mood for an adventure:
<br><em>Teddy bear, teddy bear, turn around,</em></br>
<em>Teddy bear, teddy bear, touch the ground,</em></br>
<em>Teddy bear, teddy bear, reach up high,</em></br>
<em>Teddy bear, teddy bear, eat some pie!</em></br>
<em>Teddy bear, teddy bear, go exploring,</em></br>
<em>Teddy bear, teddy bear, it's not boring,</em></br>
<em>Teddy bear, teddy bear, what will we see?</em></br>
<em>Teddy bear, teddy bear, you and me!</em></br></p>
<h1>Hunt Bears in the Clouds</h1>
<p>Another great place to go 'hunting' is in the clouds. What shapes can you spot? It's also a chance to talk to your child about the weather. <em><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nMw7w3Gof-M">Little Cloud</a></em> by Anne Booth and Sarah Massini is a lovely story which helps us to understand why rain is important. If your child is interested to learn more about clouds and the water cycle there's a good explanation <a href="https://www.natgeokids.com/uk/discover/science/nature/water-cycle/">here</a>.</p>

<p>Thanks to Carla Speedy for this fantastic piece of wild art. </p>
<p>I hope you find your toys a comfort at the moment, and that they give you the courage to have an adventure! </p>
