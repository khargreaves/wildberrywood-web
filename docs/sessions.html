    <h2>Sessions</h2>
  </div>
  <h2>Little Explorers Summer 2021</h2>
<p>Little Explorers, our forest play sessions for preschool children, take place on a Monday morning at Poverest Park, Orpington. </p>
<p>Due to to the ongoing situation regarding Covid-19 sessions must be <strong>pre-booked</strong>. Please do not come unless you are booked in. This is to ensure that we keep numbers manageable. </p>
<p>Upcoming dates for this half term are: </p>
<ul>
<li>Monday 31st May (bank holiday)</li>
<li>Monday 7th June</li>
<li>Monday 14th June</li>
<li>Monday 21st June </li>
<li>Monday 28th June</li>
<li>Monday 5th July</li>
</ul>
<p>Time: 10.15-11.45</p>
<p>The cost is £7 per child per session, or book four or more sessions in advance for the discounted price of £6 per session. Fees are payable in advance to secure your place. The recommended age range is from walking to school start. Pre-walking siblings are free of charge. </p>
<h2>Please read the following booking conditions carefully:</h2>
<ul>
<li>You MUST NOT attend if you or your child are experiencing <a href="https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/coronavirus-covid-19/symptoms/">Covid-19 symptoms</a> or are awaiting test results. Refunds will be issued if you have to cancel due to Covid-19.</li>
<li>Sessions go ahead in all weathers (except high winds and thunderstorms) so please make sure you and your child dress appropriately. It is wise to layer up. Waterproof jackets and boots are essential, and waterproof trousers or puddle suits can be useful even if it is not wet, as children like to sit on the ground. We strongly recommend wearing long sleeves and trousers and closed-toed shoes in all weathers to avoid scratches and biting insects.</li>
<li>Covet Woods is an open site used by dog walkers and other members of the public. Although we check the area before each session, please supervise your child at all times and alert the group leader to any potential hazards. </li>
<li>Hot and cold drinks will be served, but please bring your own snacks. </li>
<li>Toilets and handwashing facilities are available in the football pavilion. We will also provide extra handwashing facilities and hand sanitiser in the woods. </li>
</ul>
<p>To book your place please complete <a href="https://forms.gle/QmvYJJ1gVJeTYvpe9">this form.</a> If you have attended before and your details have not changed you can email wildberrywoodlearning@gmail.com stating the dates you'd like to book. </p>
<h2>Activities</h2>
<p>Our theme of this half term will be Let's Go Wild, inspired by the <a href="https://www.wildlifetrusts.org/30-days-wild-2021-sign-your-pack">Wildlife Trusts' 30 Days Wild challenge</a>, which aims to get everyone out and about committing 'random acts of wildness' during the month of June. </p>
<p>We believe that enjoying nature has never been more important for all our well-being. Little Explorers is run along Forest School principles of free play and child-centred learning. Children are encouraged to assess risk, and to take part in more challenging activities, such as using tools and navigating obstacles, in a managed way. The result is an increased sense of confidence and self-esteem. Plus it's lots of fun! </p>
