Little Explorers is a Forest School style group for toddlers and preschool children
and their carers. We read stories, sing songs, do nature based
activities, and have plenty of time for free play in the woods.

## When?

Monday mornings, 10am-11.30am

Our new terms begins on 13th January 2020. Please note there will be no session on  3rd February, but we will be running a half term session on Monday 17th February. 

Sessions are drop-in - feel free to join us at any point in the term. Like our [Facebook page](https://www.facebook.com/wildberrywood) page for regular updates and any last minute changes to the schedule.

It's really important to get outside at this time of year. Although it's tempting to stay snuggled up inside, fresh air, daylight and exercise are vital for keeping our minds and bodies healthy during the winter months. As long as you and your child layer up, you'll have a great time and feel better for it. Tea, coffee, hot chocolate and biscuits are provided at all sessions to keep us going! This term we have lots of fun, colourful activities planned to help us banish those winter blues:

* 13th January: The Snail and the Whale
* 20th January: Barry the Fish with Fingers
* 27th January: Year of the Rat	
* 3rd February: no session
* 10th February: *session cancelled due to high winds*
* 17th February: The Highway Rat half term fun. Older siblings are welcome to attend.

## How much?

Sessions are charged at £5 per child over 1 year. Younger siblings are welcome to come along free of charge. During the school holidays older siblings are welcome to attend.

Sessions are drop-in, no need to pre book. There are two ways to pay:
* £5 cash on the day

or

* get 6 sessions for the price of 5 with our pre-pay flexicard. Fill out the [sign up form](https://goo.gl/forms/UmXTaIS859GcpKzI2) to take advantage of this offer and get details of how to pay by bank transfer. You can use your flexicard over any time scale, it doesn't have to be for consecutive sessions. We know that plans can often change at the last minute when little ones are involved!

## Why?

There is a growing body of research that shows that everyone, young
and old, benefits from contact with nature. It relieves stress, makes
us more mindful, and creates confident, well-rounded young people. We
also believe that it's important to encourage children to respect
nature, so that they will want to protect it for the future. It's also lots of fun!

## What facilities are available?
We have access to toilets and handwashing facilities in the football pavilion. Refreshments are provided for children and grown ups.

## What will my child need to wear?
Sessions will take place in all weathers (except thunderstorms
  and high winds, for safety reasons) so please dress your child (and
  yourself!) appropriately. It is wise to layer up. Waterproof jackets
  and boots are essential, and waterproof trousers or puddle suits can
  be useful even if it is not wet, as children like to sit on the
  ground. We strongly recommend wearing long sleeves and trousers in all weathers to avoid scratches and biting insects (it is also often cooler in the woods than it feels outside). If you have any questions about suitable clothing, or would like to find out if we have any second hand kit in your size, please send us an [email](mailto:wildberrywoodlearning@gmail.com). Similarly if your child has grown out of their kit and you would like to donate it, we will see that it gets used!

## Please note
These sessions are for preschool children accompanied by a
  parent, grandparent, childminder or other carer. We are in a public
  space, and whilst efforts are made to check for hazards, it's
  important that you keep your child under supervision at all
  times. Please report any hazards found to the session leader. Other people, especially dog walkers, use the area, so please
  be mindful of this.
Please respect the site. We have permission to use the woods from Bromley council, but that permission can be withdrawn if they think we are damaging the woodland habitat. Please avoid trampling flowers and pulling leaves and twigs off trees. Please don’t drop any litter.

## We look forward to exploring with you!
